## ⚠️ Academic Integrity & AI Acknowledgment
Parts of this project were developed with assistance from **OpenAI’s ChatGPT**.  
ChatGPT was used to:
- Debug Godot/GDScript/C# errors.  
- Suggest implementations for various things.  
- Provide boilerplate code.  

All AI-assisted code was reviewed, tested, and integrated by me, the developer.  
This README and the supporting documentation were also structured with ChatGPT’s help.  
Final implementation, debugging, and project structure are my own work.
